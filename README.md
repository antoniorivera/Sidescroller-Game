Sidescroller-Game
=================

Game written in C++ using SFML

Last Edited: September 22, 2014

I, Antonio Rivera, am the sole author of this game (not including SFML. SFML was created by Laurent Gomila. SFML is available for free use under the following license: http://sfml-dev.org/license.php). It is still in the early stages of development, and right now is more of an engine than a game. My goal with this game was to create efficient collision-detection and graphics engines. I also created a Java file that turns simple black-and-white images into levels to make the level editing/creating process much faster than with my other project .I will include the Java fil (and probably the source code for everything) later.
